Design a tkinter application, screen_recorder, that has the following features:

1. Opens a window with buttons for users to start and stop recording. 
2. Provides a sleek, modern, and user-friendly graphical interface for users to apply a few common options for video recording, including resolution, frames per second, and audio input. 
3. Records both the screen, as well as audio input and output from microphones, speakers, etc
4. Once the start button is pressed, continue recording the screen until the stop button is pressed. 
5. Once the stop button is pressed, prompt the user whether they want to save the video or discard it
6. If they select save, open a file select dialog box and default to a size efficient file type
   1. the file type should be a video file type, and have separable audio and video streams
7. Also on save, if the appropriate box was checked (it is checked by default), uses computer vision to index two things to the particular point in the video:
    1. The videos will typically show excel charts and tables. The tables should be indexed to the time in the video. 
    2. The videos will typically have live transcripts. Would also want to index who is talking when. 
8. Add a help/documentation section for users to understand different features of screen recorder.
9.  The app should be flexible enough to run either the audio or the video or both through external ai
10. Uses pytorch to run the computer vision models
11. Uses class based design and object oriented programming

Please provide a step-by-step explanation and code snippets for implementing each feature in the tkinter application, as well as the overall design and structure of the application. Each step should be a single method in the overall class structure, and code snippets should be provided for each method.
